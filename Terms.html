IT AFFECTS HOW DISPUTES WITH IDLE ARE RESOLVED. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.
</blockquote><blockquote>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES AND OBLIGATIONS. THESE INCLUDE VARIOUS LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS, A CLAUSE THAT GOVERNS THE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF DISPUTES, AND OBLIGATIONS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
</blockquote><blockquote>IN PARTICULAR, AFFILIATES SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW THE LAWS WORK IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CITIES. CERTAIN TYPES OF SHORT-TERM AGREEMENTS MAY BE PROHIBITED ALTOGETHER. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS VARY GREATLY IN HOW THEY ENFORCE THESE LAWS. PENALTIES MAY INCLUDE FINES OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT. OWNERS SHOULD REVIEW LOCAL LAWS BEFORE LISTING AN ITEM ON IDLE.
</blockquote><blockquote>Last Updated: JUNE 6, 2017
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>Key Terms
</blockquote><blockquote>IDLE provides an online platform that connects Owners who have Items to list and rent to Renters seeking to rent such Items (collectively, the “Services“), which Services are accessible at www.GETIDLE.com and any other websites through which IDLE makes the Services available (collectively, the “Site“) and as applications for mobile, tablet and other smart devices and application program interfaces (collectively, the “Application“).
</blockquote><blockquote>If you are using the Site, Application or Services and you reside in the USA, these Terms of Service are between you and IDLE, LLC. 
</blockquote><blockquote>“Item” means privately owned tool, equipment, other property, or labor hours.
</blockquote><blockquote>“IDLE Content” means all Content that IDLE makes available through the Site, Application, Services, or its related promotional campaigns and official social media channels, including any Content licensed from a third party, but excluding Affiliate Content.
</blockquote><blockquote>“Agreement” means a limited license granted by the Owner to the Renter to use the Listing for the limited duration of the confirmed Agreement, during which time the Owner (only where and to the extent permitted by applicable law) retains the right to retrieve the Item, in accordance with the Renter’s agreement with the Owner. Please note, as used on the Site, Applications, and Services, “short term rental” and “tool sharing” have the same meaning as “Agreement;” all three terms mean a limited license to use the Item for the duration of the confirmed Agreement as defined above.
</blockquote><blockquote>“Rental Request Period” means the time-period starting from the time when a Agreement is requested by a Renter (as determined by IDLE in its sole discretion), within which an Owner may decide whether to confirm or reject that Agreement request, as stated on the Site, Application or Services. Different Agreement Request Periods may apply in different places.
</blockquote><blockquote>“Cumulative Content” means Affiliate Content and IDLE Content.
</blockquote><blockquote>“Communication” means an email, message via the Application, text message or message to an IDLE account.
</blockquote><blockquote>“Content” means text, graphics, images, music, software (excluding the Application), audio, video, information or other materials.
</blockquote><blockquote>“Renter” means an Affiliate who requests from an Owner an Agreement of a Listing via the Site, Application or Services, or an Affiliate who uses an Item and is not the Owner for the associated Listing.
</blockquote><blockquote>“Owner” means an Affiliate who creates a Listing via the Site, Application and Services.
</blockquote><blockquote>“Listing” means an Item that is listed by an Owner as available for Agreement via the Site, Application, and Services.
</blockquote><blockquote>“Affiliate” means a person who completes IDLE’s account registration process, including but not limited to Owners and Renters, as described under “Account Registration” below.
</blockquote><blockquote>“Affiliate Content” means all Content that an Affiliate posts, uploads, publishes, submits, transmits, or includes in their Listing, Affiliate profile or IDLE promotional campaign to be made available through the Site, Application or Services.
</blockquote><blockquote>“Tax” or “Taxes” mean any sales taxes, goods and services taxes (GST), or fees that Item providers may be required by law to collect and remit to governmental agencies, and other similar municipal, state, federal and national indirect or other withholding and personal or corporate income taxes.
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>Terms of Service
</blockquote><blockquote>By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree to comply with and be legally bound by the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service (“Terms“), whether or not you become a registered user of the Services. These Terms govern your access to and use of the Site, Application and Services and all Cumulative Content (defined below), and constitute a binding legal agreement between you and IDLE. Please also read carefully our Privacy Policy.
</blockquote><blockquote>In addition, certain areas of the Site and Application (and your access to or use of certain aspects of the Services or Cumulative Content) may have different terms and conditions, standards, guidelines, or policies posted or may require you to agree with and accept additional terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions posted for a specific area of the Site, Application, Services, or Cumulative Content, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your use of or access to that area of the Site, Application, Services, or Cumulative Content.
</blockquote><blockquote>If you do not agree to these Terms, you have no right to obtain information from or otherwise continue using the Site, Application or Services. Failure to use the Site, Application or Services in accordance with these Terms may subject you to civil and criminal penalties.
</blockquote><blockquote>THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES COMPRISE AN ONLINE PLATFORM THROUGH WHICH OWNERS MAY CREATE LISTINGS FOR ITEMS AND RENTERS MAY LEARN ABOUT AND RENT ITEMS DIRECTLY WITH THE OWNERS. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT IDLE IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BETWEEN OWNERS AND RENTERS, NOR IS IDLE AN ITEM BROKER, OWNER OR INSURER. IDLE HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE CONDUCT OF OWNERS, RENTERS AND OTHER USERS OF THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES OR ANY ITEMS, AND DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY IN THIS REGARD TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
</blockquote><blockquote>IF YOU CHOOSE TO CREATE A LISTING ON IDLE, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH IDLE IS LIMITED TO BEING AN AFFILIATE AND AN INDEPENDENT, THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTOR, AND NOT AN EMPLOYEE, AGENT, JOINT VENTURER OR PARTNER OF IDLE FOR ANY REASON, AND YOU ACT EXCLUSIVELY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF AND FOR YOUR OWN BENEFIT, AND NOT ON BEHALF OF OR FOR THE BENEFIT OF IDLE. IDLE DOES NOT CONTROL, AND HAS NO RIGHT TO CONTROL, YOUR LISTING, YOUR OFFLINE ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR LISTING, OR ANY OTHER MATTERS RELATED TO ANY LISTING, THAT YOU PROVIDE. AS AN AFFILIATE YOU AGREE NOT TO DO ANYTHING TO CREATE A FALSE IMPRESSION THAT YOU ARE ENDORSED BY, PARTNERING WITH, OR ACTING ON BEHALF OF OR FOR THE BENEFIT OF IDLE, INCLUDING BY INAPPROPRIATELY USING ANY IDLE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
</blockquote><blockquote>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITE, APPLICATION OR SERVICES OR BY DOWNLOADING OR POSTING ANY CONTENT FROM OR ON THE SITE, VIA THE APPLICATION OR THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, AND THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND RECEIVE OUR SERVICES, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE REGISTERED WITH THE SITE AND APPLICATION. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE SITE, APPLICATION, SERVICES, OR CUMULATIVE CONTENT. If you accept or agree to these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms and, in such event, “you” and “your” will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>Modification
</blockquote><blockquote>IDLE reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify the Site, Application or Services or to modify these Terms, including the Service Fees, at any time and without prior notice. If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on the Site or via the Application and/or provide you notice of the modification by email. We will also update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms. Changes to the Terms will be effective at the time of posting. Your continued access or use of the Site, Application or Services will constitute acceptance of the modified Terms. Additionally, if the modified Terms contain material changes applicable to existing Affiliates (by decreasing your rights or increasing your responsibilities), we will provide you with notice prior to the changes taking effect. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Site, Application and Services. If you do not close your IDLE Account, you will be deemed to have accepted the changes.
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>Eligibility
</blockquote><blockquote>The Site, Application and Services are intended solely for persons who are 18 or older. Any access to or use of the Site, Application or Services by anyone under 18 is expressly prohibited. By accessing or using the Site, Application or Services you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older.
</blockquote><blockquote>For users in the United States, IDLE will, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and if we have sufficient information to identify a user, obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations of the user. You agree and authorize us to use your personal information, such as your full name and date of birth, to obtain such reports, including from IDLE’s vendors.
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>How the Site, Application and Services Work
</blockquote><blockquote>The Site, Application and Services can be used to facilitate the listing and Agreement of Items. Such Items are included in Listings on the Site, Application and Services by Owners. You may view Listings as an unregistered visitor to the Site, Application and Services; however, if you wish to rent an Item or create a Listing, you must first register to create an IDLE Account (defined below).
</blockquote><blockquote>As stated above, IDLE makes available an online platform or marketplace with related technology for Renters and Owners to meet online and arrange for Agreements of Items directly with each other. IDLE is not an owner or operator of items, including, but not limited to, tools, vehicles, or other Items, nor is it a provider of tools, vehicles, or other Items and IDLE does not own, sell, resell, furnish, provide, rent, re-rent, manage and/or control Items, including, but not limited to, tools, vehicles, or other Items. Unless explicitly specified otherwise in the IDLE platform, IDLE’s responsibilities are limited to facilitating the availability of the Site, Application and Services.
</blockquote><blockquote>PLEASE NOTE THAT, AS STATED ABOVE, THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO FACILITATE OWNERS AND RENTERS CONNECTING AND MAKING AGREEMENTS FOR ITEMS DIRECTLY WITH EACH OTHER. IDLE CANNOT AND DOES NOT CONTROL THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY LISTINGS AND THE CONDITION, LEGALITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY ITEMS. IDLE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY AND ALL LISTINGS AND ITEMS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY AGREEMENTS WILL BE MADE OR ACCEPTED AT THE AFFILIATE’S OWN RISK.
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>Account Registration
</blockquote><blockquote>In order to access certain features of the Site and Application, and to rent an Item or create a Listing, you must register to create an account (“IDLE Account“) and become an Affiliate. You may register to join the Services directly via the Site or Application or as described in this section.
</blockquote><blockquote>You can also register to join by logging into your account with certain third-party social networking sites (“SNS“) (including, but not limited to, Facebook; each such account, a “Third-Party Account“), via our Site or Application, as described below. As part of the functionality of the Site, Application and Services, you may link your IDLE Account with Third-Party Accounts, by either: providing your Third-Party Account login information to IDLE through the Site, Services or Application; or  allowing IDLE to access your Third-Party Account, as permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to IDLE and/or grant IDLE access to your Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating IDLE to pay any fees or making IDLE subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers. By granting IDLE access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that IDLE will access, make available and store (if applicable) any Content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account (“SNS Content“) so that it is available on and through the Site, Services and Application via your IDLE Account and IDLE Account profile page. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all SNS Content, if any, will be considered to be Affiliate Content for all purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts will be available on and through your IDLE Account on the Site, Services and Application. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or IDLE’s access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Site, Services and Application. You have the ability to disable the connection between your IDLE Account and your Third-Party Accounts, at any time, by accessing the “Settings” section of the Site and Application. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. IDLE makes no effort to review any SNS Content for any purpose, including but not limited to for accuracy, legality or non-infringement and IDLE is not responsible for any SNS Content.
</blockquote><blockquote>Your IDLE Account and your IDLE Account profile page will be created for your use of the Site and Application based upon the personal information you provide to us or that we obtain via an SNS as described above. You may not have more than one (1) active IDLE Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. IDLE reserves the right to suspend or terminate your IDLE Account and your access to the Site, Application and Services if you create more than one (1) IDLE Account, or if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, fraudulent, not current, incomplete, or otherwise in violation of these Terms of Service.
</blockquote><blockquote>You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party.
</blockquote><blockquote>Unless expressly authorized by a specific feature on IDLE, you are not permitted to share your IDLE Account with anyone or allow others to access or use your IDLE Account. IDLE may enable features, in our discretion, that allow other Affiliates to take certain actions associated with your IDLE Account, on your behalf with your express authorization, such as having your executive assistant, agent, or employer rent on your behalf or adding a family member to your account as an additional Owner. You agree that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your IDLE Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify IDLE of any unauthorized use of your IDLE Account.
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>Item Listings
</blockquote><blockquote>As an Affiliate, you may create Listings. To create a Listing, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Item to be listed, including, but not limited to, the location, capacity, size, features, and availability of the Item and pricing and related rules and financial terms. Listings will be made publicly available via the Site, Application and Services. You understand and agree that the placement or ranking of Listings in search results may depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, Renter and Owner preferences, ratings and/or ease of Agreement.
</blockquote><blockquote>Other Affiliates will be able to rent your Item via the Site, Application and Services based upon the information provided in your Listing, your Renter requirements, and Renters’ search parameters and preferences. You understand and agree that once a Renter requests to rent your Item, you may not request the Renter to pay a higher price than in the rental request.
</blockquote><blockquote>You acknowledge and agree that you alone are responsible for any and all Listings and Affiliate Content you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the Agreement of, or a Renter’s use of, an Item in a Listing you post will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, and will be in compliance with all applicable laws (such as zoning laws), Tax requirements, Intellectual Property laws, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Item included in a Listing you post (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations), and not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that IDLE assumes no responsibility for an Owner’s compliance with any agreements with or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and regulations. IDLE reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that IDLE, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or IDLE’s standards, trademarks or branding, or otherwise harmful to the Site, Application or Services.
</blockquote><blockquote>If you are an Owner, you understand and agree that IDLE does not act as an insurer or as your contracting agent. If a Renter requests to rent your Item and uses your Item, any agreement you enter into with such Renter is between you and the Renter and IDLE is not a party to it.
</blockquote><blockquote>When you create a Listing, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Affiliates who are eligible to request a rental of your Item, such as requiring Affiliates to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to rent your Item. Any Affiliate wishing to rent Items included in Listings with such requirements must meet these requirements. 
</blockquote><blockquote>If you are an Owner, IDLE makes certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Affiliates you choose to confirm or preapprove for rental of your Item. 
</blockquote><blockquote>IDLE recommends that Owners obtain appropriate insurance for their Items. Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Item carefully, and please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of or relating to Renters (and the individuals the Renter lets use or be in the vicinity during use to the Item, if applicable) use of your Item. 
</blockquote><blockquote>IDLE may offer Owners the option of having photographers take photographs of their Items. If you as an Owner choose to have photographer do this, IDLE shall own all copyrights in photographs taken but these photographs will be made available to you to include in your Listing with a watermark or tag bearing the words “GETIDLE.com Verified Photo” or similar wording (“Verified Images“). You agree that you alone are responsible for ensuring that your Listing is accurately represented in the Verified Images. You alone are responsible for using the Verified Images for your Listing and you warrant that you will cease to use the Verified Images or any other images if such images cease to accurately represent your Listing or if you cease to be an Owner for the Listing featured. All images, materials and content created by these photographers, including Verified Images, constitute IDLE Content, regardless of whether you include them in your Listing and you agree not to use them except in your Listing without prior authorization from IDLE. If your IDLE Account is terminated or suspended for any reason, you shall not use Verified Images in any way. You agree that IDLE retains its right to and may use the Verified Images for advertising, marketing, commercial and other business purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to your Listing or otherwise, without further notice or compensation.
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>No Endorsement
</blockquote><blockquote>IDLE does not endorse any Affiliate, Listing or Item. You understand that Verified Images are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of the Item at the time the photograph was taken. Verified Images are therefore not an endorsement by IDLE of any Affiliate, Listing or Item.
</blockquote><blockquote>Affiliates are required by these Terms to provide accurate information. Although IDLE may, for transparency or fraud prevention or detection purposes, directly or through third parties, ask you to provide a form of government identification, your date of birth, and other information, or undertake additional checks and processes designed to help verify or check the identities or backgrounds of Affiliates and/or screen Affiliate information against third party databases or other sources, we do not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse any Affiliate or the Affiliate’s purported identity or background.
</blockquote><blockquote>By registering for an IDLE Account, you agree that IDLE may - but is not obligated to - request a consumer report on you from a Consumer Reporting Agency. If we do request a consumer report, we’ll request and use it in compliance with applicable law, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
</blockquote><blockquote>Any references in the Site, Application or Services to an Affiliate being “verified” or “connected” (or similar language) only indicate that the Affiliate has completed a relevant verification or identification process, and does not represent anything else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by IDLE about any Affiliate, including of the Affiliate’s identity and whether the Affiliate is trustworthy, safe or suitable. Instead, any such description is intended to be useful information for you to evaluate when you make your own decisions about the identity and suitability of others whom you contact or interact with via the Site, Application and Services. We therefore recommend that you always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to interact with an Owner or to accept or preapprove an Agreement request from a Renter, or to have any other interaction with any other Affiliate. IDLE is not responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other Affiliates.
</blockquote><blockquote>By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Affiliates or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Affiliates or other third parties who caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from IDLE with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Affiliates on the Site and Services regarding any Agreements or Listings made by you. This limitation shall not apply to any claim by an Owner against IDLE regarding the remittance of payments received from a Renter by IDLE on behalf of an Owner, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled “Limitation of Liability”.
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>Agreements and Financial Terms
</blockquote><blockquote>Key definitions
</blockquote><blockquote>“Item Fees” means the amounts that are due and payable by a Renter in exchange for that Renter’s use of an Item. The Owner alone, and not IDLE, is responsible for the Item Fees for his or her Listing. The Owner may in his or her sole discretion decide to include in these amounts a service or handling fee or any other fee permitted on the IDLE platform, or Taxes that the Owner determines that he or she has to collect.
</blockquote><blockquote>“Renter Fees” means the fee that IDLE charges a Renter for the use of the Services, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Item Fees. The Renter Fees will be displayed to the Renter when the Renter is asked whether to send an Agreement request to an Owner.
</blockquote><blockquote>“Owner Fees” means the fee that IDLE charges an Owner for the use of the Services, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Item Fees.
</blockquote><blockquote>“Payment Method” means a payment method that you have added to your IDLE Account, such as a credit card, debit card or PayPal.
</blockquote><blockquote>“Service Fees” means collectively the Renter Fees and the Owner Fees.
</blockquote><blockquote>“Total Fees” means collectively the Item Fees and the Renter Fees plus any Taxes.
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>Agreements and Financial Terms for Owners
</blockquote><blockquote>If you are an Owner and an Agreement is requested for your Item via the Site, Application or Services, you will be required to either preapprove, confirm or reject the Agreement request within the Agreement Request Period, otherwise the Agreement request will automatically expire. When an Agreement is requested via the Site, Application or Services, we will share with you the first and last name of the Renter who has requested the Agreement, a link to the Renter’s IDLE Account profile page,  if the Renter and Owner have both connected their IDLE accounts to SNS and have not turned off sharing of social connections, the names of any shared connections on such SNS, and an indication of whether or not the Renter has provided other information to IDLE, such as a verified email address, connection to SNSs, or a government ID. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject an Agreement request within the Agreement Request Period, any amounts collected by IDLE for the requested Agreement will be refunded to the applicable Renter. When you confirm an Agreement requested by a Renter, IDLE will send you a Communication confirming such Agreement, depending on the selections you make via the Site, Application and Services.
</blockquote><blockquote>IDLE will collect the Total Fees from Renters at the time of the Agreement request or upon the Owner’s confirmation and will initiate payment of the Item Fees (less applicable fees and taxes) to the Owner once the item is returned and the transaction is completed and verified.
</blockquote><blockquote>Each Owner agrees that IDLE may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Owner and reflected in the relevant Listing, permit the Renter to cancel the Agreement and refund to the Renter that portion of the Item Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy.
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>Agreements and Financial Terms for Renters
</blockquote><blockquote>The Owners, not IDLE, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed Agreements and making available any Items reserved through the Site, Application and Services. If you, as a Renter, choose to enter into a transaction with an Owner for the rental of an Item, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Owner and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Item imposed by the Owner.
</blockquote><blockquote>You acknowledge and agree that you, and not IDLE, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that IDLE is not a party to such agreements, and that IDLE (inclusive of all subsidiaries) disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements.
</blockquote><blockquote>The Total Fees payable will be displayed to a Renter before the Renter sends an Agreement request to an Owner. As noted above, the Owner is required to either preapprove, confirm or reject the Agreement request within the Agreement Request Period; otherwise, the requested Agreement will be automatically cancelled. Upon receipt of your Agreement request, IDLE may initiate a pre-authorization and/or charge a nominal amount to your Payment Method. If a requested Agreement is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Owner), any amounts collected by IDLE will be refunded to such Renter, depending on the selections the Renter makes via the Site and Application, and any pre-authorization of such Renter’s Payment Method will be released, if applicable.
</blockquote><blockquote>You as a Renter agree to pay the Total Fees for any Agreement requested, and in most cases confirmed, in connection with your IDLE Account. IDLE will collect the Total Fees.
</blockquote><blockquote>Once your confirmed Agreement transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation Communication summarizing your confirmed Agreement.
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>Service Fees and Other Fees
</blockquote><blockquote>In consideration for the use of IDLE’s online marketplace and platform, IDLE charges Service Fees. IDLE collects these Service Fees, and, where applicable, may also collect Taxes in respect of the Owner Fees and Renter Fees. IDLE deducts the Owner Fees from the Item Fees before remitting the balance to the Owner. Renter Fees are, as noted above, included in the Total Fees.
</blockquote><blockquote>Applicable Renter Fees, as well as Taxes collected by IDLE, will be shown to Renters via the Site and Application at checkout, prior to their submission of an Agreement request. And, IDLE will disclose applicable Owner Fees to Owners via the Site and Application. 
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>General Agreement and Financial Terms
</blockquote><blockquote>Cancellations and Refunds
</blockquote><blockquote>If, as a Renter, you wish to cancel a confirmed Agreement made via the Site, Application and Services, either prior to or after receiving the Item, the cancellation policy of the Owner contained in the applicable Listing will apply to such cancellation. Our ability to refund the Item Fees, Renter Fees and other amounts charged to you will depend upon the terms of the applicable cancellation policy. Details regarding refunds and cancellation policies are available via the Site and Application. The Renter Fee is non-refundable unless otherwise indicated in the cancellation policy selected by the Owner. IDLE will initiate any refunds.
</blockquote><blockquote>If an Owner, for an appropriate reason, cancels a confirmed Agreement made via the Site, Services, and Application, IDLE will refund the Total Fees for such Agreement to the applicable Renter the Renter will receive a Communication from IDLE containing alternative Listings and other related information. If the Renter requests an Agreement from one of the alternative Listings and the Owner associated with such alternative Listing confirms the Renter’s requested Agreement, then the Renter agrees to pay IDLE the Total Fees relating to the confirmed Agreement for the Item in the alternative Listing, in accordance with these Terms. If an Owner cancelled a confirmed Agreement and you, as a Renter, have not received a Communication from IDLE, please contact IDLE.
</blockquote><blockquote>If, as an Owner, you cancel a confirmed Agreement, you agree that IDLE may apply penalties or consequences to you or your Listing, including publishing an automated review on your Listing indicating that an Agreement was cancelled, keeping the calendar for your Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled Agreement, or imposing a cancellation fee. You will be notified of the situations in which a cancellation fee applies before you decide to cancel.
</blockquote><blockquote>In certain circumstances, IDLE may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary or desirable to cancel a confirmed Agreement made via the Site, Application and Services. This may be for any reason. IDLE may also determine, in its sole discretion, to refund to the Renter part or all of the amounts charged to the Renter. You agree that IDLE and the relevant Renter will not have any liability for such cancellations or refunds.
</blockquote><blockquote>Resolution Center
</blockquote><blockquote>Affiliates may use the Resolution Center to send or request money for refunds, services or damages related to their Agreements. You agree to pay all amounts sent through the Resolution Center in connection with your IDLE Account, and IDLE will handle all such payments. When an Affiliate agrees to provide services or conveniences to another Affiliate via the Resolution Center, both parties acknowledge and agree that they, and not IDLE, will be responsible for performing their respective obligations of any such agreements, that IDLE is not a party to such agreements, and that IDLE (inclusive of all subsidiaries) disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements and the services or amenities provided.
</blockquote><blockquote>Rounding Off
</blockquote><blockquote>IDLE may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable from or to Renters or Owners to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (e.g. to the nearest dollar, euro or other supported currency); for example, IDLE will round up an amount of 102.00, and 101.00.
</blockquote><blockquote>Some currencies are denominated in large numbers. In those cases, IDLE may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for such currencies would be for IDLE to round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 35,450 up to 35,500 and 35,449 down to 35,400, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.
</blockquote><blockquote>Donations
</blockquote><blockquote>Some Owners may pledge to donate a portion of the funds they receive from confirmed Agreements made via the Site, Application and Services to a particular cause or charity. We do not take any responsibility or liability for whether the Owner does in fact make the donation he or she pledged to make. In such cases, the Owner in question is responsible for his or her own compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to such pledges and/or fund-raising.
</blockquote><blockquote>Agreement Modifications
</blockquote><blockquote>You as a Renter or Owner are responsible for any modifications to an Agreement that you direct IDLE Customer Service to make (“Agreement Modifications“), and you agree to pay any Item Fees, Renter Fees, Owners Fees, Services Fees, and/or Taxes associated with such Agreement Modifications.
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>Taxes
</blockquote><blockquote>Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate tax information from our Owners, or to withhold taxes from payouts to Owners, or both. You as an Owner are solely responsible for keeping the information in your tax forms current, complete and accurate. If you as an Owner fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold taxes from payments to you, we reserve the right in our sole discretion to freeze all payouts to you until resolution, to withhold such amounts as required by law, or to do both.
</blockquote><blockquote>You as an Owner understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining  your applicable Tax reporting requirements, and the Taxes that should be included, and for including Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Listings. You are also solely responsible for remitting to the relevant authority any Taxes included or received by you. IDLE cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Affiliates.
</blockquote><blockquote>Where applicable, or based upon request from an Owner, IDLE may issue a valid VAT invoice to such Owner.
</blockquote><blockquote>You understand and acknowledge that appropriate governmental agencies, departments or authorities (the “Tax Authority“) where your Item is located may require Taxes to be collected from Renters or Owners on the amount paid for the right to use, and to be remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The laws in jurisdictions may vary, but these taxes may be required to be collected and remitted as a percentage of the Item Fees set by Owners, a set amount per hour/day/month/year, or other variations. 
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>Damage to Items and Security Deposits
</blockquote><blockquote>As a Renter, you are responsible for returning the Item (including any personal or other property associated with an Item) in the condition it was in when you received it. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Renter, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the Item. In the event that an Owner claims otherwise and provides evidence of damage (“Damage Claim“), including but not limited to photographs, you agree to pay the cost of replacing the damaged items with equivalent items.
</blockquote><blockquote>Owners may choose to include security deposits in their Listings (“Security Deposits“). Each Listing will describe whether a Security Deposit is required for the applicable Item. IDLE will use commercially reasonable efforts to address Owners’ requests and claims related to Security Deposits, but IDLE is not responsible for administering or accepting any Damage Claims by Owners related to Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.
</blockquote><blockquote>If an Owner has a Damage Claim for a confirmed Agreement, the Owner can seek payment from the Renter through the Resolution Center. The Owner may escalate the Damage Claim to IDLE if the Owner and Renter are unable to resolve a Damage Claim through the Resolution Center, or immediately in certain circumstances. If an Owner escalates a Damage Claim to IDLE, you as a Renter will be notified of the Damage Claim and given an opportunity to respond. If you as a Renter agree to pay the Owner in connection with a Damage Claim, or if IDLE determines, in its sole discretion, that you are responsible for damaging an Item or any personal or other property associated with an Item, IDLE will collect any such costs from you and/or against the Security Deposit. IDLE also reserves the right to otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any avenues available to IDLE in this regard in situations in which you have been determined, in IDLE’s sole discretion, to have damaged any Item or any personal or other property associated with an Item.
</blockquote><blockquote>Both Renters and Owners agree to cooperate with and assist IDLE in good faith, and to provide IDLE with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by IDLE, in connection with any Damage Claims or other complaints or claims made by Affiliates relating to Items or any personal or other property associated with an Item or with respect to any investigation undertaken by IDLE or a representative of IDLE regarding use or abuse of the Site, Application or the Services. If you are a Renter, upon IDLE’s reasonable request, and to the extent you are reasonably able to do so, you agree to participate in mediation or similar resolution process with an Owner, at no cost to you, which process will be conducted by IDLE or a third party selected by IDLE or its insurer, with respect to losses for which the Owner is requesting payment from IDLE.
</blockquote><blockquote>If you are a Renter, you understand and agree that IDLE may make a claim under your Homeowner’s, renter’s or other insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused or been responsible for or to an Item or any personal or other property associated with an Item (including without limitation amounts paid by IDLE). You agree to cooperate with and assist IDLE in good faith, and to provide IDLE with such information as may be reasonably requested by IDLE, in order to make a claim under your Homeowner’s, renter’s or other insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as IDLE may reasonably request to assist IDLE in accomplishing the foregoing.
</blockquote><blockquote>Security Deposits, if required by an Owner, may be applied to any fees due from a Renter keeping an item for longer than the agreed upon rental duration without the Owner’s consent.
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>Keeping/Failure to Return Item without the Owner’s Consent
</blockquote><blockquote>Renters agree that a confirmed Agreement is merely a license granted by the Owner to the Renter to use the Item for the limited duration of the confirmed Agreement and in accordance with the Renter’s agreement with the Owner. Renters further agree return the Item no later than the agreed upon time that the Owner specifies in the Listing or such other time as mutually agreed upon between the Owner and Renter. If a Renter fails to return Item within the agreed upon time without the Owner’s consent, they no longer have a license to use the Item and the Owner is entitled to make the Renter return the Item. In addition, Renters agree that the Owner can charge the Renter, for each hour that the Renter keeps the item beyond of the agreed upon duration without the Owner’s consent, an additional hourly fee of two times the average hourly Item Fee originally paid by the Renter to cover the inconvenience suffered by the Owner, plus all applicable Service Fees, Taxes, and any legal expenses incurred by the Owner to make the Renter return the item (collectively, “Additional Sums“). IDLE will collect Additional Sums from Renters.

</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>

</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>Notices
</blockquote><blockquote>Any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be in writing and given by IDLE  via a Communication (in each case to the address or phone number that you provide) or  by posting to the Site or via the Application. For notices made via a Communication, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction
</blockquote><blockquote>These Terms and your use of the Services will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Louisiana and the United States of America, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in East Baton Rouge Parish, Baton Rouge, Louisiana or a United States District Court for any actions for which the parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below.
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>III Dispute Resolution
</blockquote><blockquote>If you reside in the United States, you and IDLE agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site, Application or Cumulative Content (collectively, “Disputes“) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and IDLE are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class Affiliate in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and IDLE otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.
</blockquote><blockquote>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. This agreement to arbitrate evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA“) in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules“) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.
</blockquote><blockquote>Arbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Louisiana and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
</blockquote><blockquote>Arbitration Location and Procedure. Unless you and IDLE otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and IDLE submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
</blockquote><blockquote>Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. IDLE will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
</blockquote><blockquote>Fees. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, IDLE will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
</blockquote><blockquote>Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if IDLE changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of IDLE’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and IDLE in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>General
</blockquote><blockquote>The failure of IDLE to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of IDLE. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>Third party beneficiary
</blockquote><blockquote>These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties.
</blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>Contacting IDLE
</blockquote><blockquote>If you have any questions about these Terms or any App Store Sourced Application, please contact IDLE.
